# Assignment1-7PAM2000-0105-2021


In this Assessment it is your turn to do some research! You are expected to generate
a 2 page report that presents a basic analysis and visualisation of a data set of your
choosing. Find below a link list for good sources of data, but you are welcome to find
other sources. Please check the quality. Some data sets can be quite messy and are better
avoided at this stage.
The goal is to tell a story using data. You are expected to identify an open access
(i.e. public) data set and provide the reader with an easily digestible summary of its main
properties, interesting features, trends, etc. The report should contain explanatory text,
tables and figures. Pick the tools which best transport the information.
You will be expected to use the three visualisation methods (i.e. types of graphs)
covered in the lectures, but also feel free to explore other techniques if you wish. The
code should make good use of functions. The minimum expected would be one for reading
and processing of the data and one for each visualisation method. Best, if you write
the functions in a way that they can be used more than once. Do not forget to put a
short explanatory docstring at the beginning of the function (see bootcamp or https:
//docs.python.org/3.10/tutorial/controlflow.html#defining-functions).
The report should focus on the “story” and not include much technical information
on the programming. However, you should include short descriptions why you choose a
visualisation method. Did you try out alternatives.
You will be assessed on
•The clarity of your report including spelling and grammar, use of captions and
explanatory text.
•Appropriate use of visualisation techniques and statistical summaries. Quality of
figures (e.g. legibility, proper labelling). Use of references where appropriate (e.g.
data sources, any unusual techniques employed).
The exact format and layout of the report is up to you, but you should follow these
guidelines:
•It should be no more than two A4 pages (PDF format please) with 1.5 cm margins
all around.
•The minimum font size should be 11 pt, with the exception of figure labels, footnotes
and references.
•The report should have a clear title and short abstract or introductory paragraph
explaining the topic and finish with some conclusions.
An overall coding quality mark will be awarded combined from your three submissions.
Part marks for this assignment and advice for improvement will be part of your feedback.
Criteria
•Adherence to the PEP-8 guidelines.
•Well structured and commented program, good use of functions. No spaghetti code
please.
•Good use of your repository with an appropriate level of commitments. (How to
use a repo is explained in Lecture 1).
